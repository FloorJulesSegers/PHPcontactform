# PHP Contact Form

Processing a contact form with HTML for the visuals and a backend script for the data and to compose an email message for the client.

## Getting started

### Installing
I used [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (the only PHP function that supports this is the mail() function) and used the GitHub [PHPMailer](https://github.com/PHPMailer/PHPMailer) tutorial to install it

```
composer require phpmailer/phpmailer
```
